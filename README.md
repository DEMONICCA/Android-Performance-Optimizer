> [!NOTE]
> - This module is an optimization solution for Android systems designed to improve device performance and stability.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features ‚ú®:
> 1. Advanced SQLite optimization with WAL mode, PRAGMA tuning, ANALYZE, REINDEX, VACUUM, and safe permission handling. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 2. Adaptive I/O tuning with smart scheduler selection, read-ahead control, rotational disable, and noatime remounts. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 3. Dual ZRAM setup with memory-based sizing, lz4/lzo compression, and high-priority swap configuration. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 4. RAM profile-based memory management including swappiness, cache pressure, dirty ratios, lowmemorykiller, and scheduler tuning. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 5. Automatic ART optimization (`cmd package compile`) and background dexopt job for faster app performance. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 6. Secure filesystem trimming (fstrim) across all main partitions to reduce wear and maintain speed. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 7. Extended UI optimization with SurfaceFlinger, HWUI, EGL, rendering, and animation properties. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 8. Gaming mode with CPU/GPU scaling, governor tuning, min/max frequency control, scheduler tweaks, and notification suppression. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 9. Aggressive thermal control to disable throttling, trip points, cooling devices, and thermal services. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 10. Multi-vendor GPU optimization with governor tuning, frequency scaling, bus governor, and throttling control. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 11. Touch optimization with input booster, latency reduction, polling tweaks, and 240Hz report rate. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 12. Entropy optimization with rng selection, jitterentropy support, and stricter kernel entropy parameters. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 13. Kernel optimization disabling unnecessary logging, panic triggers, and improving OOM handling. ‚úîÔ∏è  
> 14. Auto-detection of root environment (KernelSU, Magisk, APatch) and Android version for dynamic module description. ‚úîÔ∏è  
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Supports `Magisk` `KernelSU - NEXT` `APatch` dan `SukiSU`.
> 2. Minimum Android `10 sdk 29`.
